Project Olympus_QUIZ

Task:
Using C# language, dotnet 6 runtime.
Create a Windows console application which does the following:
1. Create a text file at location /log/out.txt. Initialize this file by writing the string “0, 0, current_time_stamp” 
to the first line of the file where "current_time_stamp" is a string of the form HH:MM:SS.mmm 
(HH = hours, MM = minutes, SS=seconds, mmm = milliseconds
to 3 decimal places.)
2. Launch 10 threads to run simultaneously. Each thread should do the following as fast as
possible (i.e. do not insert sleeps or spin waits – however appropriate protection must be
added to synchronize access to the file shared resource):
	a. Open the file
	b. Read the first number on the last line of the file. This is your counter.
	c. Increment this counter
	d. Append to the next line in the file “incremented_counter_value, thread_id, current_time_stamp” where thread_id is the current thread id.
	e. Close the file
3. Each thread should gracefully terminate after it has performed 10 writes to the file.
4. When all ten threads have terminated, wait for a character press, then exit.
